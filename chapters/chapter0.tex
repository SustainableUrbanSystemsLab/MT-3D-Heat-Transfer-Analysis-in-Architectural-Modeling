\chapter{Introduction and Background}
Architects and engineers refer to ASHRAE standards to comply with the minimum required insulation based on the location of a project. 
In adhering to these standards, there is the potential to optimize the selection of materials toward lower energy demand and to increase thermal comfort. 
However, modeling 3D heat transfer for applications in buildings is a complex and long process for modelers due to the lack of available free software. 

This thesis aims to bridge the gap between providing architects with easy-to-use 3D heat transfer software that is integrated into architect design software, such as \textit{Rhino\, \&\, Grasshopper}. Here, we used \textit{OpenFOAM (OF) / Grasshopper} to construct an envelope segment from \textit{ISO 10211:2007}
\cite{ISO}, then calculate heat transfer, and assess whether the validated case complies with our results. 



\subsubsection{Problem Statement}
Current software and simulation tools in the architectural field are limited;2dheat, etc


Research question
How do we build and validate a tool that can simulate 3D heat transfer?



\todo{You need a section here that describes the problem statement AND the research questions your thesis answers. Please check my PhD thesis or masters thesis for an example of how to do this.}
