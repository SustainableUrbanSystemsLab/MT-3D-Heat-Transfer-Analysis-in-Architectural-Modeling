\chapter{2D Heat Transfer Methodology}

This chapter showcases one of the simplest heat transfer cases, which is a single layer  heat transfer methodology---in this case, a brick wall.
Understanding what resources and capabilities can be utilized, from hand calculation before a numerical method is used, is a helpful undertaking. 
Thus, this chapter presents different approaches to finding the 2D brick wall heat flux. First, an estimation of the heat flux was calculated manually. Then, the same boundary conditions were used in an experimental design, resulting in the same heat flux value. Followed by, implementing the same brick wall geometry, boundary conditions, and materials in HTflux which is a 2D heat transfer software and the resulting heat flux complies with the previous results as well. %dont know if I should add this sentence below
Finally, this 2D brick wall will be implemented in the \gls{OF} 3D heat transfer workflow presented in this project to see if the temperatures and heat flux comply with the results from the previous approaches. 




\section{Manual Estimation of Heat Flux}
This section presents the simplest heat flux calculation that can be performed manually. This exercise is the first and most traditional approach to finding heat flux for a simple brick wall geometry. The heat flux calculation for the 2D section shown in \ref{fig:2d2} \textbf{(a)} is as follows:
\begin{equation}
q = -k \frac{dT}{dx}
\end{equation}

where q is the heat flux,
k is the Thermal conductivity, and
$\frac{dT}{dx}$ is the Temperature gradient, which can be found by $\frac{T_2 - T_1}{L}$ over thickness L \cite{heattransfund}. 

Solving for q where k = 1 ${W/m}^2$, 
L = 0.43 m,
$T_1$ = 25.8\, $^\circ$\text{C}, 
$T_2$  = 21.1\, $^\circ$\text{C}



Substituting the given values:
\[ q = -1 \, \text{W/m}^2 \times \frac{21.1 \, ^\circ \text{C} - 25.8 \, ^\circ \text{C}}{0.43 \, \text{m}} \]
\[ q = 10.93 \, \text{W/m}^2 \]
So, the heat flux \( q \) is \( 10.93 \, \text{W/m}^2 \).





\section{Heat Flux Sensors Experiment}


This section presents the measurement approach to estimating heat flux, which is a real-time measurement of the 2D brick wall. The experiment was carried out in the 358D office located in the Hinman Research building\footnote{\url{https://maps.app.goo.gl/BSMCrMDtWg2PdHGL7}} with a duration of 74 hours using \gls{U}-value and heat flux sensors as shown in \ref{fig:figexp1} \textbf{(a)} and \ref{fig:figexp1} \textbf{(b)}. The experiment started on March 14, 2024, at 14:24:15 until March 17, 2024, at 15:24:15. 
The experimental design details and results are showcased in the upcoming subsections.





 
\subsubsection{Experimental Design}
 This experiment is based on using the measurement device the gSKIN® KIT-2615C (calibrated) U-Value and Heat Flux Measurement Kit from GreenTeg  \cite{greenteg} shown in \ref{fig:toolkit}. The equipment was purchased using funds received from the Micro Research Grants for Regenerative Built Environments, provided by the Kendeda Building Advisory Board \cite{kendeda}.
 The schematic in \cref{fig:2d2} shows the experimental design setup with the same conditions of k  = 1 ${W/m}^2$ 
L = 0.43 m,
$T_1$ = 25.8 $^\circ \text{C}$, 
$T_2$  = 21.1  $^\circ \text{C}$.

 \end{figure}







\subsubsection{Experiment Results}
This section showcases the results from the sensor reading for the brick wall. The GreenTeg sensor company provides software to log and visualize the data, along with writing a final report with a CSV file documenting the reading at 10-second intervals. The graph in \ref{fig:expr} represents the results of the temperature and heat flux of the brick wall. 
The report indicates that the final resulting U value = 2.31 ${W/m^2k}$. Thus, according to the boundary conditions and the given results, the heat flux is \( q \) is \( 10.93\, {W/m}^2 \). 
Where U-value from the report = 2.31\, ${W/m^2k}$ and 
\begin{equation}
    U = \frac{k}{L}
      = \frac{1}{0.43} = 2.33\,  {W/m^2k}
\end{equation}
Where k = 1 \text{W/(m²)}, L (thickness) = 0.43. So, \(U_{\text{calc}}\) = \(U_{\text{exp}}\) = 2.31 ${W/m^2k}$ 

\ref{fig:expr} below is a plot report showing the experimental design results of the fluctuations in indoor and outdoor temperature along with the heat flux. From the report, three temperatures from different time steps were selected to be compared with the 3D simulation results. Also, \ref{table2d} shows the comparison of the selected three points, where $T_{val}$ is the experiment's resulting temperature and $T_{sim}$ is the simulation's resulting temperature. 
The measurement approach represented in this section offers detailed time-step values for temperature and heat flux. However, the cost of the sensor kit is high: \$2,157. Another issue with this approach is the time spent setting up and receiving results, where the minimum required reading time is 73 hours. Thus, the next section presents an easier and faster method of finding the heat flux, which is using a 2D heat transfer simulation.

\section{Simulation}
\subsubsection{2D Simulation}
Moving to the third approach, which is to use 2D heat transfer software, where the same brick wall is modeled in HTFlux. 
HTFlux is a software that simulates 2D heat transfer seamlessly and calculates the heat flux by providing the temperature gradient \cite{HTflux}. 
The boundary conditions assigned in this simulation are the same as the previous methods which are; brick thermal conductivity is k = 1 ${W/m}^2$ L = 0.43 m,
$T_1$ = 25.8 $^\circ \text{C}$, 
$T_2$  = 21.1  $^\circ \text{C}$ .

\end{figure}


\subsubsection{3D Simulation Compliance}\label{3dbrick}
Although Chapter 4 explains the process of building the 3D heat transfer workflow in detail and validating the results with an ISO case, we returned to the brick wall in this chapter to model it with the 3D \gls{OF} simulation to further validate the results. So, the line plots in \ref{fig:expr} are the experimental design results and the points are the 3D heat transfer simulation results. \ref{error2d} is a comparison of the percentage of error between the results of the experiment and the 3D heat transfer workflow, where the average is from 0.003\% to 0.01\%.
According to ISO \cite{ISO} to validate the case, the percentage of error shall not exceed 0.1\%.

        Standard Deviation & 0.0033\% & 0.0176\% \\

\section{Discussion}
This section successfully presented the resources to calculate the heat flux of a 2D brick wall using three methods, which are by calculation, using sensors, using 2D simulation software where the heat flux q, respectively, = \( 10.93 \, {W/m}^2 \), \( 10.93 \, {W/m}^2 \), and \( 10.91 \, {W/m}^2 \). However, the approaches in this chapter are not convenient for modelers to seamlessly simulate 3D heat transfer. 
Thus, the gap in 3D heat transfer simulation integrated into architecture modeling software is still missing and will be presented in the next chapter. \todo{might not need to say that here that the gap is still not addressed} 
In this chapter, \ref{3dbrick} is work carried out after validation of the 3D heat transfer workflow, where the simulation is used to further validate the simulation using the brick wall example.
