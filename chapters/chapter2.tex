\chapter{2D Heat Transfer Methodology}
The first step before experimenting with the 3D heat transfer simulation is to understand the simplest form of heat transfer in buildings. This chapter presents the calculation of a 2D section of a single-layer brick wall. Followed by the experimental design, results, and discussion.

\section{Manual Estimation of Heat Flux}
The heat flux calculation for the 2D section shown in \ref{fig:2d2} \textbf{(a)} is as follows:
\begin{equation}
q = -k \frac{dT}{dx}
\end{equation}

where q is the heat flux,
k is the Thermal conductivity, and
$\frac{dT}{dx}$ is the Temperature gradient, which can be found by $\frac{T_2 - T_1}{L}$ over thickness L \cite{heattransfund}. 

Solving for q where k = 1 ${W/m}^2$, 
L = 0.43 m,
$T_1$ = 25.8 \, $^\circ$ \text{C}, 
$T_2$  = 21.1 \, $^\circ$ \text{C}



Substituting the given values:
\[ q = -1 \, \text{W/m}^2 \times \frac{21.1 \, ^\circ \text{C} - 25.8 \, ^\circ \text{C}}{0.43 \, \text{m}} \]
\[ q = 10.93 \, \text{W/m}^2 \]
So, the heat flux \( q \) is \( 10.93 \, \text{W/m}^2 \).





\section{Experiment}
\todo{needs better section title, not just "experiment"}


This section presents a real-time measurement of the 2D brick wall with a duration of 74 hours\todo{add dates and which building. where did we measure} using U-value and heat flux sensors as shown in \ref{fig:figexp1} \textbf{(a)} and \ref{fig:figexp1} \textbf{(b)}. Then followed by a 2D simulation section where the same experimental design conditions are implemented in HTflux \cite{HTflux} a 2D heat transfer simulation software.

\subsubsection{Experimental Design}
 The  measurement device used was the gSKIN® KIT-2615C (calibrated) U-Value and Heat Flux Measurement Kit from GreenTeg \cite{greenteg} shown in \ref{fig:toolkit}. 
 The schematic in \cref{fig:2d2} shows the experimental design setup with the same conditions of k  = 1 ${W/m}^2$ 
L  = 0.43 m,
$T_1$ = 25.8 $^\circ \text{C}$, 
$T_2$  = 21.1  $^\circ \text{C}$ .

   \label{fig:toolkit}
 \end{figure}






\subsubsection{Experiment Results}
The chart in \ref{fig:expr} represents the reading results of 74 hours. The final resulting U value = 2.31 ${W/m^2k}$ from the report and the temperatures show compliance with the calculation section above \( q \) is \( 10.93 \, {W/m}^2 \). 
Where U-value from the report = 2.31 ${W/m^2k}$ and 
\begin{equation}
    U = \frac{k}{\text{L}}
      = \frac{1}{\text{0.43}} = 2.33  {W/m^2k}
\end{equation}
Where k = 1 \text{ W/(m²)}, L (thickness) = 0.43. So, \(U_{\text{calc}}\) = \(U_{\text{exp}}\) = 2.31 ${W/m^2k}$ 

\ref{fig:expr} below is a plot report showing the experimental design results of the fluctuations in indoor and outdoor temperature along with the heat flux. From the report, three temperatures from different time steps were selected to be compared with the 3D simulation results. Also, \ref{table2d} shows the comparison of the selected three points, where $T_{val}$ is the experiment's resulting temperature and $T_{sim}$ is the simulation's resulting temperature.

\section{Simulation}
\todo{add subsections here that make very clear that the first simulations are done with OpenFOAM, the others are done with HTFlux}

After successfully finding and ensuring the compliance of the heat flux in the two methods, which are the calculation and the experiment, the final method uses a 2D heat transfer simulation, HTFlux \cite{HTflux}. The same brick wall with the same boundary conditions is constructed in the software as shown in \ref{2dconst} \textbf{(a)} which shows the materials and the boundary condition and \textbf{(b)} represents the 2D simulation results where the resulting heat flux = \( q \) is \( 10.91 \, {W/m}^2 \) as expected.

\section{Discussion}
This section successfully presented the resources to calculate the heat flux of a 2D brick wall using three methods, which are by calculation, using sensors, using 2D simulation software where the heat flux q, respectively, = \( 10.93 \, {W/m}^2 \), \( 10.93 \, {W/m}^2 \), and \( 10.91 \, {W/m}^2 \). However, the gap of 3D heat transfer simulation is still missing. Thus, chapter 3 showcases the workflow of a free 3D heat transfer simulation.
