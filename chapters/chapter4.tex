\chapter{Conclusion}
This thesis presents an automated integration between  \gls{GH}, Rhino, and \gls{OF} workflow to simulate 3D heat transfer in architectural applications. 
By utilizing OF, this research fills a critical gap in current design practices and is capable of improving energy-efficient building design and data-driven material selection. 

This 3D heat transfer workflow can help inform building performance decisions such as the selection of suitable materials, the analysis of thermal comfort, and the insulation.
The stated aspects all are determined using data-driven decisions by either using machine learning, optimization, or analysis software. \todo{what does this mean?!}
Thus, having an integrated 3D heat transfer workflow incorporated from the preliminary design phase to the schematic phase is essential to ultimately reduce the building's operational and embodied carbon emissions. 

Future work in this field involves packaging the \gls{GH} automation workflow into a user-friendly plug-in. 
A plug-in would simplify the process of simulating 3D heat transfer for other modelers, allowing them not only to build the case and create the mesh, but also to run any \gls{OF} simulations without the need to manually write text files. 
By offering this plug-in, modelers will be able to easily leverage the potential of \gls{OF} for their projects, facilitating broader adoption and exploration of advanced simulation techniques. 
Another potential is to expand the current workflow into a comprehensive 3D heat transfer toolkit. \todo{what is the difference between a plugin and a toolkit? Please fix. I would just leave one.}
This toolkit would allow easier simulations to view heat transfer throughout the building, providing a more holistic approach to building thermal analysis. 
Moreover, \gls{OF} is capable of simulating to predict mold growth or condensation by changing the solver but using this same workflow. \todo{fix sentence, this is not english. First you can predict condensation via hygrothermal simulation. Condensation can potentially lead to mold growth.}
Finally, future work also includes modifying the solver inputs, specifically the system file, to include radiation in the simulation to have precise results in cases where short- and long-wave radiations are critical.
