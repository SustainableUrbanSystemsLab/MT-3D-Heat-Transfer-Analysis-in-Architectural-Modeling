\chapter{Conclusion}
This thesis presents an automated integration between  \gls{GH}, Rhino, and \gls{OF} workflow to simulate 3D heat transfer in architectural applications. 
By utilizing \gls{OF}, this research fills a critical gap in current design practices and is capable of improving energy-efficient building design and data-driven material selection. 

This 3D heat transfer workflow can help in building performance decisions such as suitable material selection, thermal comfort analysis, and insulation.
The stated aspects all are determined using data-driven decisions by either using machine learning, optimization, or analysis software. Thus, having an integrated 3D heat transfer tool incorporated from the preliminary design phase to the schematic phase is essential to ultimately reduce the building's operational and embodied carbon emissions. 

Future work in this field includes packaging the  \gls{GH} automation to provide a user-friendly  \gls{GH} plug-in. Also, using the same CHT solver to simulate for transient state 3D heat transfer or predict condensation and moisture. By leveraging advanced computational tools like  \gls{OF} and integrating them seamlessly into existing design software offers a practical solution to a challenge and provides architects with the means to make informed decisions easier and faster. 

\section*{Research Outcomes}
First, this research was supported by a Microgrant from the Kendeda Building Advisory Board  \cite{kendeda} where funds were used to purchase the U-value measurement kit.\footnote{\url{https://web.archive.org/web/20240423144814/https://research.gatech.edu/micro-research-grants-awarded}}
The outcomes of this simulation experiment were presented at the Kendeda Microgrant Symposium in Spring 2024. 
A condensed version of this thesis has been accepted for submission in the 2024 International Building Physics conference proceedings in Toronto, Canada \cite{ibpc}.
