\chapter{Conclusion}
In conclusion, this research presents a noticeable advancement in the field of sustainable architecture and building physics by introducing an automated integration between GH, rhino, and OF to present thermal performance analysis in the architectural design process. By utilizing OF, this research fills a critical gap in current design practices and is capable of improving energy-efficient building design and data-driven material selection. Future work in this field includes packaging the GH automation to provide a user-friendly GH plug-in. Leveraging advanced computational tools like OpenFOAM and integrating them seamlessly into existing design software offers a practical solution to a challenge and provides architects with the means to make informed decisions easier and faster. Decisions are but are not limited to, suitable material selection, thermal comfort analysis, WWR, orientation, insulation, and many more. The stated aspects all are determined using data-driven decisions by either using machine learning, optimization, or analysis software. Thus, having an integrated 3d heat transfer tool incorporated from the preliminary design phase to the schematic phase is essential to ultimately reduce the building's operational and embodied carbon emissions. 

\section{Research Outcomes}
Submitting our research to different venues has created numerous professional opportunities. First, this research won the Kendeda Microgrant featured in \cite{kendeda} where the funds were used to purchase the u-value kit. Also, the second part of the microgrant is presenting the findings at a symposium in Spring 2024. Third, a conference paper is accepted at the International Building Physics conference in Toronto, Canada \cite{ibpc}. Finally, the project was accepted at the International Symposium on Sustainable Systems and Technology (ISSST) 2024 Conference in
Baltimore, Maryland as a poster presentation \cite{issst}.
