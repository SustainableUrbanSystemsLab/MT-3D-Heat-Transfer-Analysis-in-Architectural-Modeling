As the global focus on sustainable building practices intensifies, architects face the challenge of designing structures that meet aesthetic and functional criteria and minimize energy consumption. 
A critical aspect of achieving energy-efficient buildings is the selection of appropriate building materials with optimal thermal properties. 






The tools and software to simulate 2D heat transfer are available but limited or cost prohibitive. However, the integration of 3D thermal performance analysis into the architectural design process is an even more complex and underdeveloped area. 
This research aims to address this gap by exploring the use of \textit{OpenFOAM} to develop a user-friendly tool that empowers architects to make informed decisions about material selection and its impact on energy efficiency by seamlessly simulating for 3D heat transfer.
