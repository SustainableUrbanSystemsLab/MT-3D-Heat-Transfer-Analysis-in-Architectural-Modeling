![Thesis Cover Image.](https://myoctocat.com/assets/images/base-octocat.svg)

## Abstract

[As global initiatives increasingly focus on sustainable building practices, architects are tasked with designing structures that not only fulfill aesthetic and functional requirements, but also minimize energy consumption. One critical aspect of achieving energy-efficient buildings is the selection of appropriate building materials with optimal thermal properties. 
The tools and software to simulate 2D/3D heat transfer are available, but often with limited features and are cost-prohibitive. The limitations of 2D heat transfer are the inability to simulate and explore complex geometry, corners, and the full analysis of the building envelope.
The integration of 3D thermal performance analysis into the architectural design process is an even more complex and underdeveloped area. 


This thesis aims to address this gap by exploring the use of OpenFOAM to develop a user-friendly workflow to simulate building-related heat transfer problems.
The outcomes of this thesis aim to empower architects to make informed decisions about material selection and their impact on energy efficiency, by seamlessly embedding them into the Rhino \& Grasshopper CAD environment. ]

## Abstract

[Climate change is one of the most significant challenges of our time and has severe consequences for the environment, society, and economy. The alarming increase in global land temperature, which has increased by approximately 40\% \cite{glb} recently, highlights the importance of addressing this issue. At the same time, buildings are major contributors to carbon emissions, emitting approximately 40 gigatons of $CO_2$ from operational carbon annually. To maintain the limit of global warming of 1.5 Â°C, it is necessary to reduce emissions by 10 gigatons of $CO_2$ per year, which is not feasible in the current state \cite{ipcc}.



Focusing on the architectural and construction fields, architects and engineers refer to \gls{ASHRAE} standards to comply with the minimum required insulation according to the location of a project. 
In adhering to these standards, there is a potential to optimize the selection of materials toward a lower energy demand and to increase thermal comfort. Despite these recommendations, the process of modeling 3D heat transfer in buildings is a complex and long process due to the lack of free software available. 

This thesis aims to bridge the gap between providing architects with an easy-to-use 3D heat transfer workflow that is integrated into architect design software, such as Rhino\, \&\, \gls{GH}. Here, we used \gls{OF} / \gls{GH} to construct an envelope segment from \textit{ISO 10211:2007}
\cite{ISO}, then calculate heat transfer, and assess whether the validated case complies with our results. 



\section{Problem Statement}
Simulating 3D heat transfer is challenging due to the complexity of differential equations as a result of heat flow and transfer in 3D spaces. 
This complexity creates obstacles in achieving accurate simulations, which are critical in several applications. In the architectural field, the importance of 3D heat transfer simulations is significant in analyzing thermal comfort and thermal behavior of materials. The 3D simulation also has a direct impact on building design, affecting everything from the building envelope to material choices, and even the comfort and safety of occupants. The simulation also offers a detailed description of the modeled state, where thermal bridges and complex geometries are represented precisely.
However, existing software and simulation tools in architecture are generally limited to 2D heat transfer simulations, which cannot fully show the complexities represented in 3D thermal dynamics. Tools such as HEAT2, HTFlux, and THERM, widely used in the industry, provide only a partial view of the thermal environment, leading to potential inaccuracies in architectural planning or retrofitting.

Due to these limitations, the research question is the following: What approaches can be used to design and validate a workflow that simulates 3D heat transfer in architectural contexts? How can this workflow be seamlessly integrated into existing architectural modeling software? These questions aim to bridge the gap in current simulation technology by investigating the creation of a more advanced and reliable 3D simulation solution for architectural projects.

\section{Research Hypothesis}
This research is centered on the following hypothesis.
The development and validation of an integrated 3D heat transfer workflow to reduce errors in architectural thermal analysis, offering an easier approach to architectural decision-making.]
