# 3D Heat Transfer Analysis in Architectural Modeling: A Case Study with OpenFOAM

![Thesis Cover Image.](https://github.com/kastnerp/MT-3D-Heat-Transfer-Analysis-in-Architectural-Modeling/blob/main/LaTeX/Figures/newvalleg.png)

## Abstract

As global initiatives increasingly focus on sustainable building practices, architects are tasked with designing structures that not only fulfill aesthetic and functional requirements, but also minimize energy consumption. One critical aspect of achieving energy-efficient buildings is the selection of appropriate building materials with optimal thermal properties. 
The tools and software to simulate 2D/3D heat transfer are available, but often with limited features and are cost-prohibitive. The limitations of 2D heat transfer are the inability to simulate and explore complex geometry, corners, and the full analysis of the building envelope.
The integration of 3D thermal performance analysis into the architectural design process is an even more complex and underdeveloped area. 

This thesis aims to address this gap by exploring the use of OpenFOAM to develop a user-friendly workflow to simulate building-related heat transfer problems.
The outcomes of this thesis aim to empower architects to make informed decisions about material selection and their impact on energy efficiency, by seamlessly embedding them into the Rhino \& Grasshopper CAD environment.

## Abstract

As the global focus on sustainable building practices intensifies, architects face the
challenge of designing structures that meet certain aesthetic and functional criteria while minimizing energy consumption. One critical aspect of achieving energy-efficient buildings is the selection of appropriate building materials with optimal thermal properties.

The tools and software to simulate 2D heat transfer are available, but often limited
in their set of features and cost-prohibitive. The limitations of 2D heat transfer are the
inability to simulate and explore complex geometry, corners, and full building envelope
analysis. The integration of 3D thermal performance analysis into the architectural design process is an even more complex and underdeveloped area.

This thesis aims to address this gap by exploring the use of OpenFOAM to develop a
user-friendly tool to simulate building-related heat transfer problems. The outcomes of this thesis aim to empower architects to make informed decisions about material selection, and their impact on energy efficiency, by seamlessly embedding it into the Rhino & Grasshopper CAD environment.
